query	8	language acquisition is the process by which humans acquire the capacity to perceive and comprehend language  in other words, gain the ability to be aware of language and to understand it , as well as to produce and use words and sentences to communicate. language acquisition involves structures, rules and representation. the capacity to successfully use language requires one to acquire a range of tools including phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and an extensive vocabulary. language can be vocalized as in speech, or manual as in sign. human language capacity is represented in the brain. even though human language capacity is finite, one can say and understand an infinite number of sentences, which is based on a syntactic principle called recursion. evidence suggests that every individual has three recursive mechanisms that allow sentences to go indeterminately. these three mechanisms are  relativization, complementation and coordination.there are two main guiding principles in first language acquisition  speech perception always precedes speech production, and the gradually evolving system by which a child learns a language is built up one step at a time, beginning with the distinction between individual phonemes.linguists who are interested in child language acquisition have for many years questioned how language is acquired.  lidz et al. state  the question of how these structures are acquired, then, is more properly understood as the question of how a learner takes the surface forms in the input and converts them into abstract linguistic rules and representations. language acquisition usually refers to first language acquisition, which studies infants  acquisition of their native language, whether that be spoken language or signed language as a result of prelingual deafness, though it can also refer to bilingual first language acquisition  bfla , which refers to an infant s simultaneous acquisition of two native languages. this is distinguished from second language acquisition, which deals with the acquisition  in both children and adults  of additional languages.  in addition to speech, reading and writing a language with an entirely different script compounds the complexities of true foreign language literacy. language acquisition is one of the quintessential human traits, because non humans do not communicate by using language.

query	21	shakespeare s plays have the reputation of being among the greatest in the english language and in western literature. traditionally, the plays are divided into the genres of tragedy, history, and comedy  they have been translated into every major living language, in addition to being continually performed all around the world. many of his plays appeared in print as a series of quartos, but approximately half of them remained unpublished until 1623, when the posthumous first folio was published. the traditional division of his plays into tragedies, comedies, and histories follows the categories used in the first folio. however, modern criticism has labeled some of these plays  problem plays  that elude easy categorisation, or perhaps purposely break generic conventions, and has introduced the term romances for what scholars believe to be his later comedies. when shakespeare first arrived in london in the late 1570s or early 1580s, dramatists writing for london s new commercial playhouses  such as the curtain  were combining two strands of dramatic tradition into a new and distinctively elizabethan synthesis. previously, the most common forms of popular english theatre were the tudor morality plays. these plays, celebrating piety generally, use personified moral attributes to urge or instruct the protagonist to choose the virtuous life over evil. the characters and plot situations are largely symbolic rather than realistic. as a child, shakespeare would likely have seen this type of play  along with, perhaps, mystery plays and miracle plays .the other strand of dramatic tradition was classical aesthetic theory. this theory was derived ultimately from aristotle  in renaissance england, however, the theory was better known through its roman interpreters and practitioners. at the universities, plays were staged in a more academic form as roman closet dramas. these plays, usually performed in latin, adhered to classical ideas of unity and decorum, but they were also more static, valuing lengthy speeches over physical action. shakespeare would have learned this theory at grammar school, where plautus and especially terence were key parts of the curriculum and were taught in editions with lengthy theoretical introductions.

query	44	the chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on saturday 26 april 1986, at the no. 4 nuclear reactor in the chernobyl nuclear power plant, near the city of pripyat in the north of the ukrainian ssr. it is considered the worst nuclear disaster in history and is one of only two nuclear energy disasters rated at seven the maximum severity on the international nuclear event scale, the other being the 2011 fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster in japan. the accident started during a safety test on an rbmk type nuclear reactor, which was commonly used throughout the soviet union. the test was a simulation of an electrical power outage to aid the development of a safety procedure for maintaining cooling water circulation until the back up generators could provide power   there is a time gap between the moment of power outage and the moment at which the back up generators reach full power. this operating gap was about one minute and had been identified as a potential safety problem that could cause the nuclear reactor core to overheat. three such tests had been conducted since 1982, but they had failed to provide a solution. on this fourth attempt, the test was delayed by 10 hours, so an unprepared operating shift had to perform it. during a gradual decrease of reactor power that was done in preparation for the test, the power unexpectedly dropped to a near zero level at one moment. the operators were able to partially restore power, but this put the reactor in a highly unstable condition. the risks were not made evident in the operating instructions, despite a similar accident occurring years before, and the test proceeded even though the power was still lower than prescribed. upon test completion, the operators triggered a reactor shutdown, but a combination of unstable conditions and reactor design flaws caused an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction instead.a large amount of energy was suddenly released, vapourising superheated cooling water and rupturing the reactor core in a highly destructive steam explosion. this was immediately followed by an open air reactor core fire that released considerable airborne radioactive contamination for about nine days that precipitated onto parts of the ussr and western europe, before being finally contained on 4 may 1986. the fire gradually released about the same amount of contamination as the initial explosion.  as a result of rising ambient radiation levels off site, a 10 kilometre  6.2 mi  radius exclusion zone was created 36 hours after the accident. about 49,000 people were evacuated from the area, primarily from pripyat. the exclusion zone was later increased to 30 kilometres  19 mi  radius when a further 68,000 people were evacuated from the wider area.the reactor explosion killed two of the reactor operating staff. in the emergency response that followed, 134 firemen and station staff were hospitalized with acute radiation syndrome due to absorbing high doses of ionizing radiation. of these 134 people, 28 died in the days to months afterward and approximately 14 suspected radiation induced cancer deaths followed within the next 10 years. among the wider population, an excess of 15 childhood thyroid cancer deaths were documented as of 2011. the united nations scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation  unscear  has, at multiple times, reviewed all the published research on the incident and found that at present, fewer than 100 documented deaths are likely to be attributable to increased exposure to radiation. determining the total eventual number of exposure related deaths is uncertain based on the linear no threshold model, a contested statistical model, which has also been used in estimates of low level radon and air pollution exposure. model predictions with the greatest confidence values of the eventual total death toll in the decades ahead from chernobyl releases vary, from 4,000 fatalities when solely assessing the three most contaminated former soviet states, to about 9,000 to 16,000 fatalities when assessing the total continent of europe.to reduce the spread of radioactive contamination from the wreckage and protect it from weathering, the protective chernobyl nuclear power plant sarcophagus was built by december 1986. it also provided radiological protection for the crews of the undamaged reactors at the site, which continued operating. due to the continued deterioration of the sarcophagus, it was further enclosed in 2017 by the chernobyl new safe confinement, a larger enclosure that allows the removal of both the sarcophagus and the reactor debris, while containing the radioactive hazard. nuclear clean up is scheduled for completion in 2065. the chernobyl disaster is considered the worst nuclear power plant accident in history, both in terms of cost and casualties. the initial emergency response, together with later decontamination of the environment, ultimately involved more than 500,000 personnel and cost an estimated 18 billion soviet rubles roughly us 68 billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation. the accident resulted in safety upgrades on all remaining soviet designed rbmk reactors, of which 10 continue to be operational as of 2019.

query	48	immigration is the international movement of people to a destination country of which they are not natives or where they do not possess citizenship in order to settle or reside there, especially as permanent residents or naturalized citizens, or to take up employment as a migrant worker or temporarily as a foreign worker.as for economic effects, research suggests that migration is beneficial both to the receiving and sending countries. research, with few exceptions, finds that immigration on average has positive economic effects on the native population, but is mixed as to whether low skilled immigration adversely affects low skilled natives. studies show that the elimination of barriers to migration would have profound effects on world gdp, with estimates of gains ranging between 67 and 147 percent. development economists argue that reducing barriers to labor mobility between developing countries and developed countries would be one of the most efficient tools of poverty reduction.the academic literature provides mixed findings for the relationship between immigration and crime worldwide, but finds for the united states that immigration either has no impact on the crime rate or that it reduces the crime rate. research shows that country of origin matters for speed and depth of immigrant assimilation, but that there is considerable assimilation overall for both first  and second generation immigrants.research has found extensive evidence of discrimination against foreign born and minority populations in criminal justice, business, the economy, housing, health care, media, and politics in the united states and europe.
query	49	islamic terrorism, islamist terrorism or radical islamic terrorism are terrorist acts against civilians committed by violent islamists who claim a religious motivation.the largest numbers of incidents and fatalities caused by islamic terrorism have occurred in places like iraq, afghanistan, nigeria, pakistan, yemen and syria. in 2015 four islamic extremist groups were responsible for 74  of all deaths from islamic terrorism  isis, boko haram, the taliban and al qaeda, according to the global terrorism index 2016. since approximately 2000, these incidents have occurred on a global scale, affecting not only muslim majority states in africa and asia, but also states with non muslim majority such as united states, united kingdom, france, germany, spain, belgium, russia, australia, canada, israel, china, india and philippines along with some occasional targeting of citizens from italy, sweden, denmark, new zealand, south korea and japan. such attacks have targeted both muslims and non muslims. in a number of the worst affected muslim majority regions, these terrorists have been met by armed, independent resistance groups, state actors and their proxies, and elsewhere by condemnation coming from prominent islamic figures.justifications given for attacks on civilians by islamic extremist groups come from extreme interpretations of the quran and hadith, and sharia law. these include retribution by armed jihad for the perceived injustices of unbelievers against muslims  especially by al qaeda   the belief that the killing of many self proclaimed muslims is required because they have violated islamic law and are actually unbelievers  kafir   the need to restore and purify islam by establishing sharia law, especially by restoring the caliphate as a pan islamic state  especially isis   the glory and heavenly rewards of martyrdom  the supremacy of islam over all other religions.use of the phrase  islamic terrorism  is disputed. in western political speech it has variously been called  counter productive ,  highly politicized, intellectually contestable  and  damaging to community relations . others have condemned the refusal to use the term as an act of  self deception ,  full blown censorship  and  intellectual dishonesty .
query	50	live aid was a dual venue benefit concert held on saturday 13 july 1985, as well as an ongoing music based fundraising initiative. the original event was organised by bob geldof and midge ure to raise funds for relief of the ongoing ethiopian famine. billed as the  global jukebox , the event was held simultaneously at wembley stadium in london, england, united kingdom  attended by 72,000 people  and john f. kennedy stadium in philadelphia, pennsylvania, united states  attended by about 100,000 people .on the same day, concerts inspired by the initiative happened in other countries, such as the soviet union, canada, japan, yugoslavia, austria, australia and west germany. it was one of the largest scale satellite link ups and television broadcasts of all time  an estimated audience of 1.9 billion, across 150 nations, watched the live broadcast, nearly 40  of the world population.the impact of live aid on famine relief has been debated for years. one aid relief worker stated that following the publicity generated by the concert,  humanitarian concern is now at the centre of foreign policy  for western governments. geldof states,  we took an issue that was nowhere on the political agenda and, through the lingua franca of the planet   which is not english but rock  n  roll   we were able to address the intellectual absurdity and the moral repulsion of people dying of want in a world of surplus.  he adds, live aid  created something permanent and self sustaining , but also asked why africa is getting poorer. the organisers of live aid tried, without much success, to run aid efforts directly, channelling millions of pounds to ngos in ethiopia. much of this, however, went to the ethiopian government of mengistu haile mariam   a regime the uk prime minister margaret thatcher wanted to  destabilise    and was spent on guns.
query	51	the exodus is the charter myth of the israelites. spread over the books of exodus, leviticus, numbers, and deuteronomy, it tells the story of the enslavement of the israelites in ancient egypt, their liberation through the hand of their tutelary deity yahweh, the revelations at biblical mount sinai, and their wanderings in the wilderness up to the borders of canaan, the land their god has given them.its message is that israel was delivered from slavery by yahweh, and therefore belongs to him through the mosaic covenant. the covenant s terms are that yahweh will protect his chosen people, as long as they will keep his laws and exclusively worship him. the exodus and its laws remain central to judaism, recounted daily in jewish prayers and celebrated in festivals such as passover, as well as resonating with non jewish groups, from early american settlers fleeing persecution in europe to african americans striving for freedom and civil rights. jan assmann refers to it as possibly  the most grandiose and influential story ever told. the consensus of modern scholars is that the bible does not give an accurate account of the origins of israel, which formed as an entity in the central highlands of canaan in the late second millennium bce from the indigenous canaanite culture. most scholars believe that the story of the exodus has some historical basis, but that any such basis has little resemblance to the story told in the bible. there is a widespread agreement that the composition of the torah or pentateuch, the biblical books which contain the exodus narrative, took place in the middle persian period  5th century bce , although the traditions behind it are older and can be found in the writings of the 8th century bce prophets.
query	52	world war i  often abbreviated as wwi or ww1 , also known as the first world war or the great war, was a global war originating in europe that lasted from 28 july 1914 to 11 november 1918. contemporaneously described as  the war to end all wars , it led to the mobilisation of more than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million europeans, making it one of the largest wars in history. it is also one of the deadliest conflicts in history, with an estimated nine million combatants and seven million civilian deaths as a direct result of the war, while resulting genocides and the resulting 1918 influenza pandemic caused another 50 to 100 million deaths worldwide.on 28 june 1914, gavrilo princip, a bosnian serb yugoslav nationalist, assassinated the austro hungarian heir archduke franz ferdinand in sarajevo, leading to the july crisis. in response, on 23 july, austria hungary issued an ultimatum to serbia. serbia s reply failed to satisfy the austrians, and the two moved to a war footing. a network of interlocking alliances enlarged the crisis from a bilateral issue in the balkans to one involving most of europe. by july 1914, the great powers of europe were divided into two coalitions  the triple entente consisting of france, russia, and britain and the triple alliance of germany, austria hungary, and italy  the triple alliance was only defensive in nature, allowing italy to stay out of the war until april 1915, when it joined the allied powers after its relations with austria hungary deteriorated . russia felt it necessary to back serbia and, after austria hungary shelled the serbian capital of belgrade on the 28 july, approved partial mobilisation. full russian mobilisation was announced on the evening of 30 july  on the 31st, austria hungary and germany did the same, while germany demanded russia demobilise within twelve hours. when russia failed to comply, germany declared war on russia on 1 august in support of austria hungary, with austria hungary following suit on 6 august  france ordered full mobilisation in support of russia on 2 august.german strategy for a war on two fronts against france and russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the west to defeat france within six weeks, then shift forces to the east before russia could fully mobilise  this was later known as the schlieffen plan. on 2 august, germany demanded free passage through belgium, an essential element in achieving a quick victory over france. when this was refused, german forces invaded belgium on 3 august and declared war on france the same day  the belgian government invoked the 1839 treaty of london and in compliance with its obligations under this, britain declared war on germany on 4 august. on 12 august, britain and france also declared war on austria hungary  on the 23 august, japan sided with britain, seizing german possessions in china and the pacific. in november 1914, the ottoman empire entered the war on the side of the central powers, opening fronts in the caucasus, mesopotamia, and the sinai peninsula. the war was fought in and drew upon each power s colonial empire as well, spreading the conflict to africa and across the globe. the entente and its allies would eventually become known as the allied powers, while the grouping of austria hungary, germany and their allies would become known as the central powers. the german advance into france was halted at the battle of the marne and by the end of 1914, the western front settled into a battle of attrition, marked by a long series of trench lines that changed little until 1917  the eastern front, by contrast, was marked by much greater exchanges of territory . in 1915, italy joined the allied powers and opened a front in the alps. bulgaria joined the central powers in 1915 and greece joined the allies in 1917, expanding the war in the balkans. the united states initially remained neutral, though even while neutral it became an important supplier of war materiel to the allies. eventually, after the sinking of american merchant ships by german submarines, the declaration by germany that its navy would resume unrestricted attacks on neutral shipping, and the revelation that germany was trying to incite mexico to make war on the united states, the u.s. declared war on germany on 6 april 1917. trained american forces would not begin arriving at the front in large numbers until mid 1918, but ultimately the american expeditionary force would reach some two million troops.though serbia was defeated in 1915, and romania joined the allied powers in 1916 only to be defeated in 1917, none of the great powers were knocked out of the war until 1918. the 1917 february revolution in russia replaced the tsarist autocracy with the provisional government, but continuing discontent with the cost of the war led to the october revolution, the creation of the soviet socialist republic, and the signing of the treaty of brest litovsk by the new government in march 1918, ending russia s involvement in the war. this allowed the transfer of large numbers of german troops from the east to the western front, resulting in the german march 1918 offensive. this offensive was initially successful, but failed to score a decisive victory and exhausted the last of the german reserves. the allies rallied and drove the germans back in their hundred days offensive, a continual series of attacks to which the germans had no reply. bulgaria was the first central power to sign an armistice the armistice of salonica on 29 september 1918. on 30 october, the ottoman empire capitulated, signing the armistice of mudros. on 4 november, the austro hungarian empire agreed to the armistice of villa giusti. with its allies defeated, revolution at home, and the military no longer willing to fight, kaiser wilhelm abdicated on 9 november and germany signed an armistice on 11 november 1918, effectively ending the war. world war i was a significant turning point in the political, cultural, economic, and social climate of the world. it is considered to mark the end of the second industrial revolution and the pax britannica. the war and its immediate aftermath sparked numerous revolutions and uprisings. the big four  britain, france, the united states, and italy  imposed their terms on the defeated powers in a series of treaties agreed at the 1919 paris peace conference, the most well known being the german peace treaty the treaty of versailles. ultimately, as a result of the war the austro hungarian, german, ottoman, and russian empires ceased to exist, with numerous new states created from their remains. however, despite the conclusive allied victory  and the creation of the league of nations during the peace conference, intended to prevent future wars , a second world war would follow just over twenty years later.  
query	53	a flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry. in the sense of  flowing water , the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. floods are an area of study of the discipline hydrology and are of significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and public health. flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, or ocean, in which the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries, or it may occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground in an areal flood. while the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt, these changes in size are unlikely to be considered significant unless they flood property or drown domestic animals. floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel, particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway. floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if they are in the natural flood plains of rivers. while riverine flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other bodies of water, people have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile and because rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry. some floods develop slowly, while others can develop in just a few minutes and without visible signs of rain. additionally, floods can be local, impacting a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins.
query	54	anti gravity  also known as non gravitational field  is creating a place or object that is free from the force of gravity. it does not refer to the lack of weight under gravity experienced in free fall or orbit, or to balancing the force of gravity with some other force, such as electromagnetism or aerodynamic lift. anti gravity is a recurring concept in science fiction, particularly in the context of spacecraft propulsion.  examples are the gravity blocking substance  cavorite  in h. g. wells s the first men in the moon and the spindizzy machines in james blish s cities in flight.  anti gravity  is often used to refer to devices that look as if they reverse gravity even though they operate through other means, such as lifters, which fly in the air by moving air with electromagnetic fields.
query	55	the hypertext transfer protocol  http  is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. http is the foundation of data communication for the world wide web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser. development of http was initiated by tim berners lee at cern in 1989. development of early http requests for comments  rfcs  was a coordinated effort by the internet engineering task force  ietf  and the world wide web consortium  w3c , with work later moving to the ietf. http 1.1 was first documented in rfc 2068 in 1997. that specification was obsoleted by rfc 2616 in 1999, which was likewise replaced by the rfc 7230 family of rfcs in 2014. http 2 is a more efficient expression of http s semantics  on the wire , and was published in 2015  it is now supported by major web servers and browsers over transport layer security  tls  using an application layer protocol negotiation  alpn  extension where tls 1.2 or newer is required.http 3 is the proposed successor to http 2, which is already in use on the web, using udp instead of tcp for the underlying transport protocol. like http 2, it does not obsolete previous major versions of the protocol. support for http 3 was added to cloudflare and google chrome  canary build  in september 2019, and can be enabled in the stable versions of chrome and firefox  since version 72, january 2020 .
query	56	php is a general purpose programming language originally designed for web development. it was originally created by rasmus lerdorf in 1994  the php reference implementation is now produced by the php group. php originally stood for personal home page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism php  hypertext preprocessor.php code may be executed with a command line interface  cli , embedded into html code, or used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks. php code is usually processed by a php interpreter implemented as a module in a web server or as a common gateway interface  cgi  executable. the web server outputs the results of the interpreted and executed php code, which may be any type of data, such as generated html code or binary image data. php can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control.the standard php interpreter, powered by the zend engine, is free software released under the php license. php has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.the php language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard which other implementations aimed to follow. since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal php specification.as of september 2019, over 60  of sites on the web using php are still on discontinued  eoled  version 5.6 or older  versions prior to 7.2 are no longer officially supported by the php development team, but security support is provided by third parties, such as debian.  
query	57	english grammar is the way in which meanings are encoded into wordings in the english language. this includes the structure of words, phrases, clauses, and sentences, right up to the structure of whole texts. there are historical, social, cultural and regional variations of english. divergences from the grammar described here occur in some dialects. this article describes a generalized present day standard english   a form of speech and writing used in public discourse, including broadcasting, education, entertainment, government, and news, over a range of registers from formal to informal. there are differences in grammar between the standard forms of british, american, and australian english, although these are more minor than differences in vocabulary and pronunciation. modern english has largely abandoned the inflectional case system of indo european in favor of analytic constructions. the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class  a remnant of the more extensive germanic case system of old english . for other pronouns, and all nouns, adjectives, and articles, grammatical function is indicated only by word order, by prepositions, and by the  saxon genitive or english possessive     s .eight  word classes  or  parts of speech  are commonly distinguished in english  nouns, determiners, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions. nouns form the largest word class, and verbs the second largest. unlike many indo european languages, english nouns do not have grammatical gender.

query	70	the invention of television was the work of many individuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. the first practical transmissions of moving images over a radio system used mechanical rotating perforated disks to scan a scene into a time varying signal that could be reconstructed at a receiver back into an approximation of the original image. development of television was interrupted by the second world war.  after the end of the war, all electronic methods of scanning and displaying images became standard. several different standards for addition of color to transmitted images were developed, with different regions using technically incompatible signal standards.  television broadcasting expanded rapidly after world war ii, becoming an important mass medium for advertising, propaganda, and entertainment. television broadcasts can be distributed over the air by vhf and uhf radio signals from terrestrial transmitting stations, by microwave band signals from earth orbiting satellites, or by wired transmission to individual consumers by cable tv. many countries have moved away from the original analog radio transmission methods and now use digital television standards, providing additional operating features and conserving radio spectrum bandwidth for more profitable uses. television programming can also be distributed over the internet.  television broadcasting may be funded by advertising revenue, by private or governmental organizations prepared to underwrite the cost, or in some countries, by television license fees paid by owners of receivers. some services, especially carried by cable or satellite, are paid by subscriptions.  television broadcasting is supported by continuing technical developments such as long haul microwave networks, which allow distribution of programming over a wide geographic area. video recording methods allow programming to be edited and replayed for later use. three dimensional television has been used commercially but has not received wide consumer acceptance owing to the limitations of display methods.
query	71	acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine and a key component of traditional chinese medicine  tcm  in which thin needles are inserted into the body. acupuncture is a pseudoscience because the theories and practices of tcm are not based on scientific knowledge, and it has been characterized as quackery. there is a range of acupuncture variants which originated in different philosophies, and techniques vary depending on the country in which it is performed. it is most often used to attempt pain relief, though acupuncturists say that it can also be used for a wide range of other conditions. acupuncture is generally used only in combination with other forms of treatment.the conclusions of numerous trials and systematic reviews of acupuncture are inconsistent, which suggests that it is not effective. an overview of cochrane reviews found that acupuncture is not effective for a wide range of conditions. a systematic review conducted by medical scientists at the universities of exeter and plymouth found little evidence of acupuncture s effectiveness in treating pain. overall, the evidence suggests that short term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long term benefits. some research results suggest that acupuncture can alleviate some forms of pain, though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture s apparent effects are not caused by the treatment itself. a systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias. one meta analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was cost effective as an adjunct to standard care, while a separate systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain.acupuncture is generally safe when done by appropriately trained practitioners using clean needle technique and single use needles. when properly delivered, it has a low rate of mostly minor adverse effects. accidents and infections do occur, though, and are associated with neglect on the part of the practitioner, particularly in the application of sterile techniques. a review conducted in 2013 stated that reports of infection transmission increased significantly in the preceding decade. the most frequently reported adverse events were pneumothorax and infections. since serious adverse events continue to be reported, it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk.scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional chinese concepts such as qi, meridians, and acupuncture points, and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy  qi  or meridians, which was a major part of early belief systems. acupuncture is believed to have originated around 100 bc in china, around the time the yellow emperor s classic of internal medicine  huangdi neijing  was published, though some experts suggest it could have been practiced earlier. over time, conflicting claims and belief systems emerged about the effect of lunar, celestial and earthly cycles, yin and yang energies, and a body s  rhythm  on the effectiveness of treatment. acupuncture fluctuated in popularity in china due to changes in the country s political leadership and the preferential use of rationalism or western medicine. acupuncture spread first to korea in the 6th century ad, then to japan through medical missionaries, and then to europe, beginning with france. in the 20th century, as it spread to the united states and western countries, spiritual elements of acupuncture that conflicted with western beliefs were sometimes abandoned in favor of simply tapping needles into acupuncture points.
query	72	the apgar score is a method to quickly summarize the health of newborn children against infant mortality. virginia apgar, an anesthesiologist at newyork presbyterian hospital, developed the score in 1952 to quantify the effects of obstetric anesthesia on babies.the apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values thus obtained. the resulting score ranges from zero to 10. the five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form a backronym  appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, respiration .
query	73	asthma is a common long term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. it is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and easily triggered bronchospasms. symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. these may occur a few times a day or a few times per week. depending on the person, asthma symptoms may become worse at night or with exercise.asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. environmental factors include exposure to air pollution and allergens. other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers. diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry lung function testing. asthma is classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second  fev1 , and peak expiratory flow rate. it may also be classified as atopic or non atopic, where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.there is no cure for asthma. symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by the use of inhaled corticosteroids. long acting beta agonists  laba  or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled. treatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short acting beta 2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth. in very severe cases, intravenous corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and hospitalization may be required.in 2015, 358 million people globally had asthma, up from 183 million in 1990. it caused about 397,100 deaths in 2015, most of which occurred in the developing world. asthma often begins in childhood, and the rates have increased significantly since the 1960s. asthma was recognized as early as ancient egypt. the word  asthma  is from the greek      ,  sthma, which means  panting .
query	74	back pain, also known as backache, is pain felt in the back. the back is divided into neck pain  cervical , middle back pain  thoracic , lower back pain  lumbar  or coccydynia  tailbone or sacral pain  based on the segment affected. the lumbar area is the most common area affected. episodes of back pain may be acute, sub acute, or chronic depending on the duration. the pain may be characterized as a dull ache, shooting or piercing pain, or a burning sensation. discomfort can radiate into the arms and hands as well as the legs or feet, and may include numbness, or weakness in the legs and arms. the majority of back pain is nonspecific with no identifiable causes. common underlying mechanisms include degenerative or traumatic changes to the discs and facets joints, which can then cause secondary pain in the muscles, and  nerves, and referred pain to the bones, joints and extremities. diseases and inflammation of the gallbladder, pancreas, aorta, and kidneys may also cause referred pain in the back. tumors of the vertebrae, neural tissues and adjacent structures can also manifest as back pain. back pain is common, with about nine out of ten adults experiencing it at some point in their life, and five out of ten working adults having it every year. some estimate up to 95  of people will experience back pain at some point in their lifetime. it is the most common cause of chronic pain, and is a major contributor of missed work and disability. for most individuals, back pain is self limited. in most cases of herniated disks and stenosis, rest, injections or surgery have similar general pain resolution outcomes on average after one year. in the united states, acute low back pain is the fifth most common reason for physician visits and causes 40  of missed days off work. additionally, it is the single leading cause of disability worldwide.
query	75	brian  sometimes spelled bryan in english  is a male given name of irish and breton origin, as well as a surname of occitan origin. it is common in the english speaking world. it is possible that the name is derived from an old celtic word meaning  high  or  noble . for example, the element bre means  hill   which could be transferred to mean  eminence  or  exalted one . the name is quite popular in ireland, on account of brian boru, a 10th century high king of ireland. the name was also quite popular in east anglia during the middle ages. this is because the name was introduced to england by bretons following the norman conquest. bretons also settled in ireland along with the normans in the 12th century, and  their  name was mingled with the  irish  version. also, in the north west of england, the  irish  name was introduced by scandinavian settlers from ireland. within the gaelic speaking areas of scotland, the name was at first only used by professional families of irish origin. it was the fourth most popular male name in england and wales in 1934, but a sharp decline followed over the remainder of the 20th century and by 1994 it had fallen out of the top 100. it retained its popularity in the united states for longer  its most popular period there was from 1968 1979 when it consistently ranked between eighth and tenth. the name has become increasingly popular in south america   particularly argentina and uruguay since the early 1990s. the surname brian is sometimes an english and irish variant spelling of the surname bryan. the english and french surname brian is sometimes derived from the personal celtic personal name shown above. the surname brian can also sometimes be a french surname  derived from the old occitan word brian, meaning  maggot  and used as a nickname.variants of the name include briant, brien, bran, brion, bryan, bryant, brj nn  in icelandic  and bryon. variant spellings such as  brien  are sometimes used as female given names, especially among members of the irish diaspora.  
query	76	carpal tunnel syndrome  cts  is a medical condition due to compression of the median nerve as it travels through the wrist at the carpal tunnel. the main symptoms are pain, numbness and tingling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and the thumb side of the ring finger. symptoms typically start gradually and during the night. pain may extend up the arm. weak grip strength may occur, and after a long period of time the muscles at the base of the thumb may waste away. in more than half of cases, both sides are affected.risk factors include obesity, repetitive wrist work, pregnancy, genetics, and rheumatoid arthritis. there is tentative evidence that hypothyroidism increases the risk. diabetes mellitus is weakly associated with cts. the use of birth control pills does not affect the risk. types of work that are associated include computer work, work with vibrating tools and work that requires a strong grip. diagnosis is suspected based on signs, symptoms and specific physical tests and may be confirmed with electrodiagnostic tests. if muscle wasting at the base of the thumb is present, the diagnosis is likely.being physically active can decrease the risk of developing cts. symptoms can be improved by wearing a wrist splint or with corticosteroid injections. taking nsaids or gabapentin does not appear to be useful. surgery to cut the transverse carpal ligament is effective with better results at a year compared to non surgical options. further splinting after surgery is not needed. evidence does not support magnet therapy.about 5  of people in the united states have carpal tunnel syndrome. it usually begins in adulthood, and women are more commonly affected than men. up to 33  of people may improve without specific treatment over approximately a year. carpal tunnel syndrome was first fully described after world war ii.
query	77	deoxyribonucleic acid dna  is a molecule composed of two chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. dna and ribonucleic acid  rna  are nucleic acids  alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates  polysaccharides , nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. the two dna strands are also known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides. each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen containing nucleobases  cytosine  c , guanine  g , adenine  a  or thymine  t  , a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. the nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar phosphate backbone. the nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules  a with t and c with g , with hydrogen bonds to make double stranded dna. the complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, pyrimidines and purines. in dna, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine  the purines are adenine and guanine. both strands of double stranded dna store the same biological information. this information is replicated as and when the two strands separate. a large part of dna  more than 98  for humans  is non coding, meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences. the two strands of dna run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel. attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases  informally, bases . it is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. rna strands are created using dna strands as a template in a process called transcription, where dna bases are exchanged for their corresponding bases except in the case of thymine  t , which rna substitutes for uracil  u . under the genetic code, these rna strands specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation. within eukaryotic cells, dna is organized into long structures called chromosomes. before typical cell division, these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of dna replication, providing a complete set of chromosomes for each daughter cell. eukaryotic organisms  animals, plants, fungi and protists  store most of their dna inside the cell nucleus as nuclear dna, and some in the mitochondria as mitochondrial dna or in chloroplasts as chloroplast dna. in contrast, prokaryotes  bacteria and archaea  store their dna only in the cytoplasm, in circular chromosomes. within eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins, such as histones, compact and organize dna. these compacting structures guide the interactions between dna and other proteins, helping control which parts of the dna are transcribed. dna was first isolated by friedrich miescher in 1869. its molecular structure was first identified by francis crick and james watson at the cavendish laboratory within the university of cambridge in 1953, whose model building efforts were guided by x ray diffraction data acquired by raymond gosling, who was a post graduate student of rosalind franklin at king s college london. dna is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the ergodic theorem and the theory of elasticity. the unique material properties of dna have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro  and nano fabrication. among notable advances in this field are dna origami and dna based hybrid materials.
query	78	hepatitis c is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis c virus  hcv  that primarily affects the liver. during the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. the virus persists in the liver in about 75  to 85  of those initially infected. early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. in some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop serious complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated blood vessels in the esophagus and stomach.hcv is spread primarily by blood to blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. it may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. it is not spread by superficial contact. it is one of five known hepatitis viruses  a, b, c, d, and e. diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its rna. testing is recommended in all people who are at risk.there is no vaccine against hepatitis c. prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who use intravenous drugs and testing donated blood. chronic infection can be cured about 95  of the time with antiviral medications such as sofosbuvir or simeprevir. peginterferon and ribavirin were earlier generation treatments that had a cure rate of less than 50  and greater side effects. getting access to the newer treatments however can be expensive. those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant. hepatitis c is the leading reason for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation.an estimated 143 million people  2   worldwide are infected with hepatitis c as of 2015. in 2013, about eleven million new cases occurred. it occurs most commonly in africa and central and east asia. about 167,000 deaths due to liver cancer and 326,000 deaths due to cirrhosis occurred in 2015 due to hepatitis c. the existence of hepatitis c   originally identifiable only as a type of non a non b hepatitis   was suggested in the 1970s and proven in 1989. hepatitis c infects only humans and chimpanzees.
query	79	insomnia, also known as sleeplessness, is a sleep disorder in which people have trouble sleeping. they may have difficulty falling asleep, or staying asleep as long as desired. insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. it may result in an increased risk of motor vehicle collisions, as well as problems focusing and learning. insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month.insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, restless leg syndrome, menopause, certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. other risk factors include working night shifts and sleep apnea. diagnosis is based on sleep habits and an examination to look for underlying causes. a sleep study may be done to look for underlying sleep disorders. screening may be done with two questions   do you experience difficulty sleeping   and  do you have difficulty falling or staying asleep  sleep hygiene and lifestyle changes are typically the first treatment for insomnia. sleep hygiene includes a consistent bedtime, exposure to sunlight, a quiet and dark room, and regular exercise. cognitive behavioral therapy may be added to this. while sleeping pills may help, they are associated with injuries, dementia, and addiction. these medications are not recommended for more than four or five weeks. the effectiveness and safety of alternative medicine is unclear.between 10  and 30  of adults have insomnia at any given point in time and up to half of people have insomnia in a given year. about 6  of people have insomnia that is not due to another problem and lasts for more than a month. people over the age of 65 are affected more often than younger people. females are more often affected than males. descriptions of insomnia occur at least as far back as ancient greece.  
query	80	the kidneys are two bean shaped organs found in vertebrates. they are located on the left and right in the retroperitoneal space, and in adult humans are about 11 centimetres  4.3 in  in length.  they receive blood from the paired renal arteries  blood exits into the paired renal veins. each kidney is attached to a ureter, a tube that carries excreted urine to the bladder. the nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. each human adult kidney contains around 1 million nephrons, while a mouse kidney contains only about 12,500 nephrons. the kidney participates in the control of the volume of various body fluid compartments, fluid osmolality, acid base balance, various electrolyte concentrations, and removal of toxins. filtration occurs in the glomerulus  one fifth of the blood volume that enters the kidneys is filtered. examples of substances reabsorbed are solute free water, sodium, bicarbonate, glucose, and amino acids.  examples of substances secreted are hydrogen, ammonium, potassium and uric acid. the kidneys also carry out functions independent of the nephron. for example, they convert a precursor of vitamin d to its active form, calcitriol  and synthesize the hormones erythropoietin and renin. renal physiology is the study of kidney function. nephrology is the medical specialty which addresses diseases of kidney function   these include chronic kidney disease, nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, acute kidney injury, and pyelonephritis. urology addresses diseases of kidney  and urinary tract  anatomy  these include cancer, renal cysts, kidney stones and ureteral stones, and urinary tract obstruction.procedures used in the management of kidney disease include chemical and microscopic examination of the urine  urinalysis , measurement of kidney function by calculating the estimated glomerular filtration rate  egfr  using the serum creatinine  and kidney biopsy and ct scan to evaluate for abnormal anatomy. dialysis and kidney transplantation are used to treat kidney failure  one  or both sequentially  of these are almost always used when renal function drops below 15 . nephrectomy is frequently used to cure renal cell carcinoma.
query	81	naproxen, sold under the brand name aleve among others, is a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug  nsaid  used to treat pain, menstrual cramps, inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, and fever. it is taken by mouth. it is available in immediate and delayed release formulations. onset of effects is within an hour and last for up to twelve hours.common side effects include dizziness, headache, bruising, allergic reactions, heartburn, and stomach pain. severe side effects include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, and stomach ulcers. the heart disease risk may be lower than with other nsaids. it is not recommended in people with kidney problems. use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy.naproxen is a nonselective cox inhibitor. it is in the propionic acid class of medications. as an nsaid, naproxen appears to exert its anti inflammatory action by reducing the production of inflammatory mediators called prostaglandins. it is metabolized by the liver to inactive metabolites.naproxen was patented in 1967, and approved for medical use in the united states in 1976, where it is available over the counter and as a generic medication. in the united kingdom, it cost about  0.15 per dose in 2017. in the united states, the wholesale cost per dose is less than us 0.10 as of 2018. in 2016, it was the 68th most prescribed medication in the united states, with more than 11 million prescriptions.
query	82	in vertebrates, the pubic bone is the ventral and anterior of the three principal bones composing either half of the pelvis.
query	83	the respiratory system  also respiratory apparatus, ventilatory system  is a biological system consisting of specific organs and structures used for gas exchange in animals and plants. the anatomy and physiology that make this happen varies greatly, depending on the size of the organism, the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history. in land animals the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs. gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs called alveoli in mammals and reptiles, but atria in birds. these microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply, thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood. these air sacs communicate with the external environment via a system of airways, or hollow tubes, of which the largest is the trachea, which branches in the middle of the chest into the two main bronchi. these enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes, the bronchioles. in birds the bronchioles are termed parabronchi. it is the bronchioles, or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds. air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing which involves the muscles of respiration. in most fish, and a number of other aquatic animals  both vertebrates and invertebrates  the respiratory system consists of gills, which are either partially or completely external organs, bathed in the watery environment. this water flows over the gills by a variety of active or passive means. gas exchange takes place in the gills which consist of thin or very flat filaments and lammelae which expose a very large surface area of highly vascularized tissue to the water. other animals, such as insects, have respiratory systems with very simple anatomical features, and in amphibians even the skin plays a vital role in gas exchange. plants also have respiratory systems but the directionality of gas exchange can be opposite to that in animals. the respiratory system in plants includes anatomical features such as stomata, that are found in various parts of the plant.
query	84	self esteem is an individual s subjective evaluation of their own worth. self esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself  for example,  i am unloved ,  i am worthy   as well as emotional states, such as triumph, despair, pride, and shame.  smith and mackie  2007  defined it by saying  the self concept is what we think about the self  self esteem, is the positive or negative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it. self esteem is an attractive psychological construct because it predicts certain outcomes, such as academic achievement, happiness, satisfaction in marriage and relationships, and criminal behavior. self esteem can apply to a specific attribute  for example,  i believe i am a good writer and i feel happy about that   or globally  for example,  i believe i am a bad person, and i feel bad about myself in general  . psychologists usually regard self esteem as an enduring personality characteristic  trait self esteem , though normal, short term variations  state self esteem  also exist. synonyms or near synonyms of self esteem include many things  self worth, self regard,  self respect, and self integrity.  
query	85	shock is the state of insufficient blood flow to the tissues of the body as a result of problems with the circulatory system. initial symptoms of shock may include weakness, fast heart rate, fast breathing, sweating, anxiety, and increased thirst. this may be followed by confusion, unconsciousness, or cardiac arrest, as complications worsen.shock is divided into four main types based on the underlying cause  low volume, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive shock. low volume shock, also known as hypovolemic shock, may be from bleeding, diarrhea, vomiting, or pancreatitis. cardiogenic shock may be due to a heart attack or cardiac contusion. obstructive shock may be due to cardiac tamponade or a tension pneumothorax. distributive shock may be due to sepsis, anaphylaxis, injury to the upper spinal cord, or certain overdoses.the diagnosis is generally based on a combination of symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory tests. a decreased pulse pressure  systolic blood pressure minus diastolic blood pressure  or a fast heart rate raises concerns. the heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure, known as the shock index  si , of greater than 0.8 supports the diagnosis more than low blood pressure or a fast heart rate in isolation.treatment of shock is based on the likely underlying cause. an open airway and sufficient breathing should be established. any ongoing bleeding should be stopped, which may require surgery or embolization. intravenous fluid, such as ringer s lactate or packed red blood cells, is often given. efforts to maintain a normal body temperature are also important. vasopressors may be useful in certain cases. shock is both common and has a high risk of death. in the united states about 1.2 million people present to the emergency room each year with shock and their risk of death is between 20 and 50 .
query	86	skin is the soft outer tissue covering of vertebrates with three main functions  protection, regulation, and sensation.other animal coverings, such as the arthropod exoskeleton, have different developmental origin, structure and chemical composition. the adjective cutaneous means  of the skin   from latin cutis, skin . in mammals, the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue, and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs. skin of a different nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. all mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and porpoises which appear to be hairless. the skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. for example, the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, and the production of vitamin d folates.  severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue. this is sometimes discoloured and depigmented. the thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism. in humans for example, the skin located under the eyes and around  the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick, and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as  crows feet  and wrinkles. the skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and is the thickest skin on the body. the speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of estrogen.fur is dense hair. primarily,  fur augments the insulation the skin provides but can also serve as a secondary sexual characteristic or as camouflage. on some animals, the skin is very hard and thick, and can be processed to create leather. reptiles and fish have hard protective scales on their skin for protection, and birds have hard feathers, all made of tough   keratins. amphibian skin is not a strong barrier, especially regarding the passage of chemicals via skin and is often subject to osmosis and diffusive forces. for example, a frog sitting in an anesthetic solution would be sedated quickly, as the chemical diffuses through its skin.  amphibian skin plays key roles in everyday survival and their ability to exploit a wide range of habitats and ecological conditions.
query	87	speech disorders or speech impediments are a type of communication disorder where  normal  speech is disrupted. this can mean stuttering, lisps, etc. someone who is unable to speak due to a speech disorder is considered mute.
query	88	spinal muscular atrophy  sma  is a group of neuromuscular disorders that result in the loss of motor neurons and progressive muscle wasting. the severity of symptoms and age of onset varies by the type. some types are apparent at or before birth while others are not apparent until adulthood. all generally result in worsening muscle weakness associated with muscle twitching. arm, leg and respiratory muscles are generally affected first. associated problems may include problems with swallowing, scoliosis, and joint contractures. sma is a leading genetic cause of death in infants.spinal muscular atrophy is due to a genetic defect in the smn1 gene. they are inherited from a person s parents in an autosomal recessive manner. the smn1 gene encodes smn, a protein necessary for survival of motor neurons. loss of these neurons prevents the sending of signals between the brain and skeletal muscles. diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing.treatments include supportive care such as physical therapy, nutrition support, and mechanical ventilation. the medication nusinersen, which is injected around the spinal cord, slows the progression of the disease and improves muscle function. in 2019, the gene therapy onasemnogene abeparvovec was approved in the us as a treatment for children under 24 months. outcomes vary by type from a life expectancy of a few months to mild muscle weakness with a normal life expectancy. the condition affects about 1 in 10,000 people at birth.
query	89	testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and anabolic steroid. in male humans, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. in addition, testosterone is involved in health and well being, and the prevention of osteoporosis. insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss. testosterone is a steroid from the androstane class containing a keto and hydroxyl groups at the three and seventeen positions respectively. it is biosynthesized in several steps from cholesterol and is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites.  it exerts its action through binding to and activation of the androgen receptor. in humans and most other vertebrates, testosterone is secreted primarily by the testicles of males and, to a lesser extent, the ovaries of females. on average, in adult males, levels of testosterone are about 7 to 8 times as great as in adult females. as the metabolism of testosterone in males is more pronounced, the daily production is about 20 times greater in men. females are also more sensitive to the hormone.in addition to its role as a natural hormone, testosterone is used as a medication in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men, transgender hormone therapy for transgender men, and breast cancer in women. since testosterone levels decrease as men age, testosterone is sometimes used in older men to counteract this deficiency. it is also used illicitly to enhance physique and performance, for instance in athletes.
query	90	thyroid hormones are two hormones produced and released by the thyroid gland, namely triiodothyronine  t3  and thyroxine  t4 .  they are tyrosine based hormones that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism. t3 and t4 are partially composed of iodine. a deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of t3 and t4, enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as simple goitre. the major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine  t4 , which has a longer half life than t3. in humans, the ratio of t4 to t3 released into the blood is approximately 14 1. t4 is converted to the active t3  three to four times more potent than t4  within cells by deiodinases  5  iodinase . these are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine  t1a  and thyronamine  t0a . all three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium containing enzymes, thus dietary selenium is essential for t3 production. edward calvin kendall was responsible for the isolation of thyroxine in 1915. in 2016 levothyroxine, a manufactured form of thyroxine, was the most prescribed medication in the united states with more than 114 million prescriptions.
query	91	trichinosis is a parasitic disease caused by roundworms of the trichinella type. during the initial infection, invasion of the intestines can result in diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. migration of larvae to muscle, which occurs about a week after being infected, can cause swelling of the face, inflammation of the whites of the eyes, fever, muscle pains, and a rash. minor infection may be without symptoms. complications may include inflammation of heart muscle, central nervous system involvement, and inflammation of the lungs.trichinosis is mainly spread when undercooked meat containing trichinella cysts is eaten. most often this is pork, but infection can also occur from bear and dog meat. several species of trichinella can cause disease, with t. spiralis being the most common. after being eaten, the larvae are released from their cysts in the stomach. they then invade the wall of the small intestine, where they develop into adult worms. after one week, the females release new larvae that migrate to voluntarily controlled muscles, where they form cysts. the diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and confirmed by finding specific antibodies in the blood, or larvae on tissue biopsy.the best way to prevent trichinosis is to fully cook meat. a food thermometer can verify that the temperature inside the meat is high enough. infection is typically treated with antiparasitic medication such as albendazole or mebendazole. rapid treatment may kill adult worms and thereby stop further worsening of symptoms. both medications are considered safe, but have been associated with side effects such as bone marrow suppression. their use during pregnancy or in children under the age of 2 years is poorly studied, but appears to be safe. treatment with steroids is sometimes also required in severe cases. without treatment, symptoms typically resolve within three months.worldwide, about 10,000 infections occur a year. at least 55 countries including the united states, china, argentina, and russia have had recently documented cases. while the disease occurs in the tropics, it is less common there. rates of trichinosis in the united states have decreased from about 400 cases per year in the 1940s to 20 or fewer per year in the 2000s. the risk of death from infection is low.
query	92	urinary incontinence  ui , also known as involuntary urination, is any uncontrolled leakage of urine. it is a common and distressing problem, which may have a large impact on quality of life. it has been identified as an important issue in geriatric health care. the term enuresis is  often used to refer to urinary incontinence primarily in children, such as nocturnal enuresis  bed wetting .pelvic surgery, pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause are major risk factors. urinary incontinence is often a result of an underlying medical condition but is under reported to medical practitioners. there are four main types of incontinence  urge incontinence due to an overactive bladder stress incontinence due to poor closure of the bladder overflow incontinence due to either poor bladder contraction or blockage of the urethra functional incontinence due to medications or health problems making it difficult to reach the bathroomtreatments include pelvic floor muscle training, bladder training, surgery, and electrical stimulation. behavioral therapy generally works better than medication for stress and urge incontinence. the benefit of medications is small and long term safety is unclear. urinary incontinence is more common in older women.

query	124	alan mathison turing     23 june 1912   7 june 1954  was an english mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist. turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. despite these accomplishments, he was not fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime, due to his homosexuality, and because much of his work was covered by the official secrets act. during the second world war, turing worked for the government code and cypher school  gc cs  at bletchley park, britain s codebreaking centre that produced ultra intelligence. for a time he led hut 8, the section that was responsible for german naval cryptanalysis. here, he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of german ciphers, including improvements to the pre war polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the enigma machine. turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the allies to defeat the nazis in many crucial engagements, including the battle of the atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war. due to the problems of counterfactual history, it is hard to estimate the precise effect ultra intelligence had on the war, but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives.after the war, turing worked at the national physical laboratory, where he designed the automatic computing engine, which was one of the first designs for a stored program computer. in 1948, turing joined max newman s computing machine laboratory at the victoria university of manchester, where he helped develop the manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. he wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the belousov zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts  the labouchere amendment of 1885 had mandated that  gross indecency  was a criminal offence in the uk. he accepted chemical castration treatment, with des, as an alternative to prison. turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. an inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. in 2009, following an internet campaign, british prime minister gordon brown made an official public apology on behalf of the british government for  the appalling way he was treated . queen elizabeth ii granted turing a posthumous pardon in 2013. the alan turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the united kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.in july 2019, the bank of england announced that turing would be depicted on the united kingdom s new  50 note.
query	125	aristotle    greek              aristot l s, pronounced  aristot l  s   384 322 bce  was a greek philosopher and polymath during the classical period in ancient greece. he was the founder of the lyceum and the peripatetic school of philosophy and aristotelian tradition. along with his teacher plato, he has been called the  father of western philosophy . his writings cover many subjects   including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics and government. aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him, and it was above all from his teachings that the west inherited its intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. as a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the west and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion. little is known about his life. aristotle was born in the city of stagira in northern greece. his father, nicomachus, died when aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. at seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined plato s academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty seven  c. 347 bc . shortly after plato died, aristotle left athens and, at the request of philip ii of macedon, tutored alexander the great beginning in 343 bc. he established a library in the lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls. though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication.aristotle s views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. their influence extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance, and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics. some of aristotle s zoological observations found in his biology, such as on the hectocotyl  reproductive  arm of the octopus, were disbelieved until the 19th century. his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied by medieval scholars such as peter abelard and john buridan. aristotle s influence on logic also continued well into the 19th century. he influenced islamic thought during the middle ages, as well as christian theology, especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church. aristotle was revered among medieval muslim scholars as  the first teacher  and among medieval christians like thomas aquinas as simply  the philosopher . his ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics, such as in the thinking of  alasdair macintyre and philippa foot.

query	132	jesus  c. 4 bc   c. ad 30   33 , also referred to as jesus of nazareth or jesus christ, was a first century jewish preacher and religious leader. he is the central figure of christianity. most christians believe he is the incarnation of god the son and the awaited messiah  the christ  prophesied in the old testament.virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the gospels and on how closely the jesus portrayed in the bible reflects the historical jesus. jesus was a galilean jew who was baptized by john the baptist and began his own ministry. he preached orally and was often referred to as  rabbi . jesus debated with fellow jews on how to best follow god, engaged in healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. he was arrested and tried by the jewish authorities, turned over to the roman government, and crucified on the order of pontius pilate, the roman prefect. after his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the early church.christian doctrines include the beliefs that jesus was conceived by the holy spirit, was born of a virgin named mary, performed miracles, founded the christian church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin, rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven, from where he will return. most christians believe jesus enables people to be reconciled to god. the nicene creed asserts that jesus will judge the living and the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the second coming of jesus in christian eschatology. the great majority of christians worship jesus as the incarnation of god the son, the second of three persons of the trinity. a minority of christian denominations reject trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non scriptural. the birth of jesus is celebrated annually on december 25  or various dates in january by some eastern churches  as christmas. his crucifixion is honored on good friday and his resurrection on easter. the widely used calendar era  ad , from the latin anno domini   year of the lord  , and the equivalent  alternative  ce , are based on the approximate birthdate of jesus.jesus is also revered outside of christianity. in islam, jesus  commonly transliterated as isa  is considered one of god s important prophets and the messiah. muslims believe jesus was born of a virgin, but was neither god nor the son of god. the quran states that jesus never claimed divinity. most muslims do not believe that he was crucified, but that he was physically raised into heaven by god. in contrast, judaism rejects the belief that jesus was the awaited messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill messianic prophecies, and was neither divine nor resurrected.
